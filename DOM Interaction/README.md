ACCESSING DATA FROM METHODS

You cannot directly access to the data in the methods but VueJS connects the data object with methods object via "this"



DIRECTIVES

There are several directives allows us to bind the html attributes to our vuejs code. There are several built-in directives but if you need, you can also write your own directives.

for these type of directives, we generally use

    v-bind:ATTRIBUTE syntax (v-bind:href used in our case)

And also there are directives that lets us listen some events

for these type of directives, we generally use

    v-on:EVENTTYPE
